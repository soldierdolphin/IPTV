<desc lang="es">El escenario fijo es uno de los más peculiares para un programa de comedia, y no se había visto desde el programa de situaciones cómicas norteamericano "Cheers", todo sucede en un bar y en este caso en una cantina, pero cabe resaltar que son dos programas totalmente distintos en su formato. Su personaje principal es Tunco Maclovich, que es interpretado por el presentador y productor del programa y siempre está acompañado de su amigo "Gamborimbo". Con un sentido del humor asombroso esta serie tiene segmentos cómicos que harán reír a la audiencia a carcajadas, se enfoca en la música regional mexicana de banda, tiene cantantes como invitados especiales que demuestran su talento y en medio de la música, se incluyen cuenta chistes, recomendaciones musicales, analiza las letras de las canciones y siempre hay mujeres bellas que le dan el toque femenino al espectáculo. Baile, música, comedia y diversión son una gran combinación para entretener a la tele audiencia.</desc>
